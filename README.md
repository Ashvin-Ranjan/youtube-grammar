# YouTube Grammar
Use this to find YouTube comments with bad grammar/spelling.

## Needed Libraries
Here are the needed libraries and their links from PyPi:
- [bs4](https://pypi.org/project/bs4/)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)

Also you would need [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/).

### Other Notes:
- Put words.txt in the same directory as scrape.py.
- A screenshot part will come later.
- Put ChromeDriver in the same directory as scrape.py. 
- You can edit words.txt to add words and to remove repeated words errors just but both words but with a "-" between them
